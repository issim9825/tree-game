# Small Python-based game
This project is to learn how to use the pygame module.

## My thoughts on pygame
Works fine to make mini-games,  
would rather use a Game Engine  
like Unity or Unreal Engine for large-scale games

## Upcoming features
- Sell threes
- Buy items
- character selection
- levels
- etc..
